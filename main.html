            <br><br>Dear future production supporters,<br><br>
            Nice to meet you all. I’m very glad to be able to reach out to you, the future producers/funds/grants of this project. I’m Handi Kim who is a future director. There's a high possibility that I have never met you before in real life. Yes.
            We probably don’t know each other. So it is fair if you were to think “Why me?” But still, I would like to share a very personal story with you. Maybe afterwards, it’ll be clear why.<br>
            A piece of my life will be revealed to you, an audience unbeknownst to me, and I would like to ask you to appreciate this story in more universal terms, so that it will be applicable to any of you. By sending this mail, I hope and
            believe a direct bridge between you and me will be built, particularly if we don’t know one another. I dare you to engage with and dedicate a bit of your time and energy to the coming story. And then, maybe, I hope that our interaction
            allows us, the recipients (and maybe even appreciators) of the magical girl genre, to take action and steer the magical girl towards a brighter future.
            <br><br>
            This is the first time that I attempt to suggest my scenario to the public, let me introduce myself properly. As already mentioned above, my name is Handi Kim, the future director. I am from South Korea, currently living in the
            Netherlands. To be honest, I wouldn’t say anything is particularly special about me, except one thing, and it’s all to do with ‘magical girls’. You may have heard of them. I used to be a trainee to become a magical girl for almost 20
            years. You can guess how much I was dedicated to it. Ultimately however, I dropped out, or rather, was kicked out.<br>
            For you, this all could sound a bit surreal. It may be quite bewildering as to why I, a person unbeknownst to you, sent this weirdly specific email out to people unbeknownst to me. Some of you may just simply move this mail to the bin.
            Some of you may giggle and say, “A trainee for being a magical girl? What is this person talking about?”, and some of you might be very interested and already have some questions.
            <br><br>
            I would like to share some images with those of you who are still with me.
            Look at these images. What do you see? What catches your eye? What do you think about the portrayal of the girls’ characters? How old do you think they are? In short, what impressions do they leave with you?
            <br><br>
            Magical girl is the sort of fantasy girl I wished I could have been like for 20 years and the ultimate goal for womanhood I was guided towards as a trainee. When you see these images of magical girls, do you feel maybe that there seems
            to be something to be concerned about?<br>
            By sending this mail, I would like to throw a metaphorical pebble at your windows and unpack the rather ugly truths behind a very beautiful story. A story which is told again and again through popular entertainment and therewith got
            ingrained in the minds of our youngest generations.
            I would like to tell a story created and sustained by advocates of a patriarchal society, and which has a very specific goal set in place for the women of the future. A goal which may not have their own best interests at heart, and which
            holds no consideration for who those women really are, but a goal which is nonetheless idealised and presented as an inherent conviction. 
            Hopefully, this mail makes you feel interested, and lets you decide to jump into more of the mails coming further. I really would love to share my concerns with you about these goals and the means put in place to have them be reached.
            Please do tell me what you think.
            I look forward to hearing from you all.
            <br><br><br>
            All the best,<br>

            <br><br>Hello all,<br><br>

            Thank you for your kind attention. I’m pleased that you guys are interested in my suggested discussion on the implications and significations of the ‘magical girl’ idolisation. It was good to take all of your small questions into account before sharing a more detailed story to follow up my introductory email. In a way, I should have of course expected that you would ask about what exactly a ‘magical girl’ is. I will attempt to give you that answer.
            <br><br>
            The concept of magical girls originated in Shojo culture(literally “little female” culture) in Japan. Shojo originally referred to girls around the ages of 12 and 13. The subculture has been widely imitated across various genres and media, among which manga(comics), drama, animation, film, and songs. The stories of the magical girls primarily focus on girls’ adolescent struggles, friendship and love, and/or their growth in overcoming failure. They are meant to speak to teenage girls and help them realise they themselves could also be the centre of their worlds, and even be important in the world at large.
            In the 60s and 70s, when Japanese animation was first shown in mainstream media, it mainly targeted boys. Most of the content in the media, as such, was focused on the ‘country of boys’, as Saito Minako writes in her book Koitenron.<br>
            It was quite obvious, therefore, that the arrival of Shojo culture, with its focus, for the first time, on girls and their perception of the world, was a huge success in the media market. It directly became a hit among girls who wished to build a place in the world that was, finally, about them. A little space for girls only, in that big country of men. 
            The very first magical girl anime appeared in 1996 with a show called Sally the Witch(魔法使いサリー). It follows Sally, princess of the magic world Astoria, and shows her episodic journey as she makes friends, uses magic, and tries to understand Earth. From that animation on, the concept of the magical girl was explored further and further until it became its own established genre. “In the worlds of manga and anime, shojo(girls) are everywhere” states Tufts University professor Susan Napier in “Anime from Akira to Princess Mononoke”.
            The image of magic and power on screen then inevitably turned into an actual, real-life goal to be reached for the young girls who grew up watching shows like Sally the Witch. What these new special girl protagonists represented was an enrichment of female ambition and place in society. Girls could now not only dream of being little princesses waiting to be saved by some knight, but also to become powerful in and of themselves, by turning into a real-life magical girl. 
            <br><br>
            My daily life was filled with patriarchy and, as anything in society, was governed by heteronormativity (the idea that being heterosexual is the default mode of sexual orientation, asserted through the ever ruling gender binary). I was brought up to believe in common stupidities and gendered stereotypes, among which that “boys like trucks, girls like dolls; boys like blue, girls like pink; boys like sports, girls like makeup; boys are angry, girls are sad; boys are active heroes, girls are passive victims; boys are protagonists of stories, and girls are objects to be saved.” Like the start of every story, my motivation to become a magical girl was triggered by the (unspoken) rules of the society that I belonged to. 
            <br><br>
            I was born a girl, and my name is a girl’s name. Only girls have it. I was taught how to behave like a girl. I was dressed as a girl. The things I was expected to enjoy were girls’ things. I was made to do things in a girly manner. Growing up, there was no doubt in anyone’s mind that I was, in fact, a girl.
            l wondered why I was treated so differently from my younger brother, my next-door male friend and my classmates. I wondered why my grandmother called me ‘one’ of 9 girls while my brother, who was the only boy, was just called by his name. I wondered why I had to quit Taekwondo and play the piano. They told me it was because it was better for a girl to play a piano, not to open her legs wide for kicking. I wondered why I needed to be scolded that I walked like a man and eventually I learnt how to walk in a pretty way. I wondered why I was refused to be a class representative, and needed to support the boy who was chosen instead.
            And, now you can imagine how much I was impressed by the girls who save the world with magic power. The saviours who came to tear the expectations in my girly life apart, my magical girls. After seeing the overwhelming presence of the magical girls who dared to become the protagonists of their own story, I started dreaming of becoming such a protagonist of mine, right where I belonged.
            <br><br>
            Thank you for reading another one of my emails. I hope it helps you to be more interested in my project. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. 
            Looking forward to receiving your comments.<br><br><br>

            All the best,<br>
            Handi Kim<br><br><br>
